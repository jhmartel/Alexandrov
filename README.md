# Alexandrov

This directory contains the outlines of an ongoing research project wherein we apply our results on Kantorovich's contravariant singularity functor to
Alexandrov spaces. Our main goal is to obtain a new simple proof of Perelman's SOUL theorem, and especially with applications to singular Alexandrov spaces.
This is a work in progress.
